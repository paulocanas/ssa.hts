# ssa.hts

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ssa.hts is to use singular spectrum analysis to forecast hierarchical time series.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ssa.hts from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("numbats/assignment-1-package-creation-paulocanas")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ssa.hts)
## basic example code
x <- datasets::AirPassengers[1:15]
L <- 8
ssa.hts::hankel_matrix(x, L)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

Plot of the data:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(datasets::AirPassengers)
```

#In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
